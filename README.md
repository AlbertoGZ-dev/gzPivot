## Roadmap features
- Ability to set origin for mutiple object selection, per-object-basis and per-group-basis.
- Set pivot to bounding box edge middles.
- Add interactive mode to set origin in the viewport by gizmo handler with snap.
- Wished replacing buttons with icons as soon as possible to control the icon size in the button operator type.
